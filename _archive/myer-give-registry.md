When a woman leaves abuse, all she often leaves with is her life. Rebuilding it begins with the basics most of us take for granted. Something we knew Myer, Australiaâ€™s largest department store, could help with. So we created the Give Registry, a gift registry with a difference. A joint initiative uniting Myer with the Salvation Army, the Give Registry is an essential list of items that women need most when starting over. Hand-picked by survivors of abuse, items ranging from a towel to a teacup can be purchased on behalf of a woman in need. Far from a one-off campaign, The Give Registry now operates year-round at all 67 Myer stores around the country. Helping to rebuild lives, one piece at a time.

Project created at Clemenger BBDO for Myer.
