For 100 years Bonds has been Australiaâ€™s favourite underwear brand. But with the launch of a new bra range, we had to prove they cater to more than bums. To show Bonds was serious about top halves too, we redesigned their famous logo and transformed the entire brand. A single word is all it took to let the nation know that Bonds is now for Boobs.

Project created at Clemenger BBDO for Bonds.
