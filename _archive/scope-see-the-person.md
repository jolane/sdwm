Our goal was to get Australian’s to look beyond disability, and see the person instead.
We made this happen with the help of a seriously talented band called Rudely Interrupted, of which 5 of the 6 members live with disabilities. By creating a film clip for them that forced people to appreciate their ability before they could judge their disabilities, we made people change the way they think about disability. This campaign won Australia’s first and only Cannes Grand Prix for Good.
