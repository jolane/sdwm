La Trobe University believes in bold thinking with a difference. And as Official Learning Partner of the National Gallery of Victoria’s David Hockney exhibition they had the opportunity to prove it. Inspired by Hockney’s vibrant landscapes and designed to protect them, Living Landscapes is a hands-on experience that invites gallery goers to create a 3D plant in the same way that Hockney creates his art – via iPad. Using AR technology each plant is then added to an ever-growing virtual landscape at the installation. And for every plant drawn at the gallery, one is planted in reality at the La Trobe University Wildlife Sanctuary.  The result – art with an impact that united individuals with a like-minded university to help paint a greener future.
